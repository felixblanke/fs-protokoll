# `fs-protokoll.cls`
This is a $\LaTeX$ class used to write minutes for meetings of the different panels and committees of the Fachschaft Mathematik Bonn.

This is a new and improved version, based on my previous works. Besides multiple improvements, it now fully supports minutes written in German and English (by using the class arguments `ngerman` or `english`).

### document class arguments
At the moment the following document class arguments are supported:

* `draft`: *flag*, add a draft watermark
* `wideoverview`: `flag`, extend the overview on the first page further than the text width
